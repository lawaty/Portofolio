# OpenCV Libraries
https://github.com/lawaty/CV-Libraries

## Overview
OpenCV is a library used for image processing purposes like filtering, extracting objects, analyzing images and others. OpenCV interface is a bit complex for building complex AI algorithms, therefore the following libraries were built to form an abstraction layer for more organized, and maintainable scripts

## My Role
1. `Line` Library: that handles `line extraction` and `transformations` like rotating, extending, drawing perpendicular lines, and many other features
2. `Line Detection` Library: `Detects` lines in image and `filters` them according to some criteria like area, length, slope, and others
3. `PID` Library: that can be integrated with different applications of control
